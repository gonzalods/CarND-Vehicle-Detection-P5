# CarND-Vehicle-Detection-P5
Vehicle Detection Project of Nanodegree Self-Driving Car Engineer

# **Proyect: Vehicule Detection**

## **Overview**

This is the fifth proyect of Nanodegree Self-Driving Car Engineer.

The objective of the project is to detect the vehicles and mark them with boxes.


To do this, a pipeline is built with the steps that must be carried out to complete the project.
